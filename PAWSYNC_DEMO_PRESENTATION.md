### "What if your pet could tell you exactly how they're feeling?"

**Visual:** Large PAWSYNC logo with animated paw prints
**Tagline:** "PAWSYNC - Your Pet's Health Guardian, Powered by AI"

**Opening Hook (30 seconds):**
> "Every 3 seconds, a pet emergency happens that could have been prevented with early detection.
Today, we're introducing PAWSYNC - the world's first AI-powered pet health companion that doesn't
just track your pet's health, it predicts and prevents problems before they become emergencies."

## 🎯 **SLIDE 2: The Problem**

### "Pet Health is a $50B Problem"

**Key Statistics:**

- 📊 85% of pet health issues go undetected until critical
- 💰 Average emergency vet visit: $1,500-$5,000
- ⏰ Pet owners spend only 2% of time monitoring pet health
- 🏥 67% of pets don't receive preventive care

**Visual:** Split screen showing happy pet vs. emergency vet visit

**Talking Points (45 seconds):**
> "Pet parents love their furry family members, but unlike human healthcare, pets can't tell us when
something's wrong. By the time symptoms appear, it's often too late and expensive. Current solutions
are reactive, not proactive."
